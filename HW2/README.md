## FaceSwap
Perform Face Swap using google ml kit

**About the Project**

This project takes on the exciting challenge of face swapping! We'll leverage Google ML Kit's face detection capabilities to create a fun and engaging application. Users will be able to swap faces in images, replacing one face with another. This project promises to bring laughter and amusement as users create hilarious photo combinations.

**How it Works**

The main page features three tabs, Dashboard tab, Camera tab and Face Swap tab. Below are information about three tabs:

* **Dashboard:** Default tab. It shows some metrics data based on mobile sensor data.
* **Camera:** Previous feature which allows users to take photos by camera or select photos from gallery.
* **Face Swap:** New! It allows user to select two photos for Face 1 and 2. 
* If photos are valid ones including human faces, user can click on swap button to do the face swap effect.
* If photos are invalid which no human faces can be detected, user will be prompt with the error messages.
* Once the Face Swap is done, user can have the option to save the newly swapped photos to gallery.

**Development Time**

While I don't have an exact record of the hours spent, I dedicated approximately four days to complete this project.

**Challenges**

The most challenging aspect was doing the opencv import at the beginning with new project. I encountered gradle build errors
after importing new module for opencv. I couldn't resolve it even after trying many online resources. I have to give up using 
my previous codebase but to start with the code template provided by Prof Sep with the provided opencv module to continue working.
